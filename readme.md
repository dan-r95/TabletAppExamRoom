## Getting started
It is assumed that you have installed and configured NativeScript properly. If not, head to https://docs.nativescript.org/start/quick-setup and validate its correct functionality.

To start the emulator with this repository:
  > `tns preview`  OR
  > `tns run android` or `tns run ios`
  > `tns build-android --bundle` to build APK
  
### Development
This project has been developed with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [NativeScript extension](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-for-visual-studio-code). It has been tested and live-synced with a local Pixel 2 android23 emulator for the most time.
